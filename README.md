# EntityBingo
A fun game with the ClearLag plugin!

Try and guess how many entities get deleted every time it goes off. Designed for AlathraMC, however it should work just fine anywhere. Can be configured to any plugin like ClearLag by changing the config.

If using ClearLag, make sure these two config options are changed. Then give the default group the permission "lagg.broadcast".
```
use-permission-for-broadcasts: true
permission: lagg.broadcast
```
